## Project Summary

As part of the IoT Temperature reading project displayed in these repositories, this project does the sensor reading and displayis the analog value of a varistor in one of the ADC as an analog value trhough a PWM. It is a simulation of the temperature reading from a sensor. Reading will be pushed to the cloud using the MQTT protocol for further ananlysis and displayed in realtime in an Android Mobile App.

This project will evolve with additional sensors as nodes of a multilinke Sub 1Ghz network.
